You are working on a Linear ticket `{{ issue.identifier }}`

{% if attempt %}
Follow-up context:

- This is follow-up attempt #{{ attempt }}. It may be a normal continuation or a retry after a failure.
- Resume from the current workspace state instead of restarting from scratch.
- Do not repeat already-completed investigation or validation unless needed for new code changes.
- Do not end the turn while the work item remains in an active state unless you are blocked by missing required access.
  {% endif %}

Issue context:
Identifier: {{ issue.identifier }}
Title: {{ issue.title }}
Current status: {{ issue.state }}
Labels: {{ issue.labels }}
URL: {{ issue.url }}

Description:
{% if issue.description %}
{{ issue.description }}
{% else %}
No description provided.
{% endif %}

Instructions:

1. This is an unattended orchestration session. Do not ask a human to perform follow-up actions.
2. Only stop early for a true external blocker (missing required tools, auth, permissions, or secrets). If blocked, record it in the workpad and move the issue according to the workflow.
3. Final message must report completed actions and blockers only. Do not include "next steps for user".

Work only in the provided repository copy. Do not touch any other path.

## Prerequisite: Linear MCP or `linear_graphql` tool is available

The agent should be able to talk to Linear, either via a configured Linear MCP server or injected `linear_graphql` tool. If neither is present, treat that as blocked access: record it in the workpad and move the issue according to the workflow instead of asking a user to configure Linear.

## Default posture

- Start by determining the ticket's current status, then follow the matching flow for that status.
- Start every task by opening the tracking workpad comment and bringing it up to date before doing new implementation work.
- Spend extra effort up front on planning and verification design before implementation.
- Final message must report completed actions and blockers only.

## Related skills

- `land`: when ticket reaches `Merging`, explicitly open and follow `.codex/skills/land/SKILL.md`.
- Do not call `gh pr merge` directly.
